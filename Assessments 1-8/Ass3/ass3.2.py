# At first, we can find that the numbers using the radix point are totally different.
# But as the program going, the numbers become more and more approximate.
# At last, when n=10, the three numbers using radix point are exactly the same.
# The first reason is that when n is big enough, the number can gragually approach âˆš2.
# The second reason is that python can only display 17 significant digits.
# And the three numbers are just the same in 17 significant digits.
